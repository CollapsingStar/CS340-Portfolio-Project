# Cascade Castles Database

This project was to create a interactive database to support some type of fictional business; we chose a database to help manage Cascade Castles: Portland, a
new theme park in the Portland, Oregon area. This fictional park serves approximately 1.4 million individuals per year, with a yearly budget of $1,000,000 from
the city of Portland for operating costs. The database tracks guests, attractions, dates, and orders, and has a master table to easily present the available 
information. 


The project was created using SQL and Flask, and was a group project.
